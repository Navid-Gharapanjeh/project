    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict Hass avocado prices in various regions of the United States. The prediction model will utilize historical data including sales volumes, types of avocados, and regional information to forecast future prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Avocados have become an increasingly important commodity in the US market, with consumption growing significantly over the past decade. Accurate price prediction can benefit various stakeholders in the supply chain:\n",
    "- Retailers can optimize inventory management and pricing strategies\n",
    "- Distributors can better plan their operations\n",
    "- Farmers can make informed decisions about harvesting and market timing\n",
    "- Consumers can benefit from more stable pricing through better market efficiency"

    "### Primary Objectives:\n",
    "1. Develop a reliable price prediction model for Hass avocados\n",
    "2. Identify key factors influencing avocado prices\n",
    "3. Provide actionable insights for stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions:\n",
    "1. How accurately can we predict avocado prices using historical data?\n",
    "2. What features have the strongest influence on avocado prices?\n",
    "3. How do regional differences affect pricing patterns?\n",
    "4. What is the impact of organic vs. conventional classification on prices?\n",
    "5. How do seasonal patterns affect avocado prices?"
